# Shutdown-Wait--Windows-
This program was made due to a request from a viewer on one of my viewers. The program allows you to tell the OS to restart, shutdown,
or logoff within x amount of time. 
The code will have to be modify if you want to use it for Windows 7 or back.

The video link below will show you where to get the program if you just want that.
